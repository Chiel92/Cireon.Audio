============

This library is currently heavily in development. That means the project is in a state of constant flux, so it is possible that class interfaces might change without prior notice. The use of this library is thus on you own risk and I am not responsible for any breaking projects or exploding computers. If you are interesting in using this library for your project or have any questions, or maybe you have some suggestions, then feel free to drop me a message.
